App short description:
The app will be accepting images of receipts that the user will be sending over, scan the information to ensure image
clarity and usefulness of the content on the receipt, and when the content is deemed satisfactory, award the user with
a tiny sum of money for each receipt.

Quality assurance:
The data must contain information such as product bought, quantity, price, company (seller), geographical location,
along with user data such as age and sex which will be provided via the user account during the account creation.

Business case:
The business model is that the user is getting paid by our startup company for images of receipts, which in turn is
sold to data processors as consumer data information or market trends. The incentive for the user will be to submit a
large number of receipts which can amount to a decent total sum, while for the company will be to understand the types
of data that are attractive to data processor companies.

Types of customer data (https://www.nutshell.com/blog/types-of-customer-data):

    1) Basic data
        Basic, or identity data, is just that—it’s the basic information you gather from customers that identifies them
        as unique individuals.

        Basic customer data includes a customer’s:

            - Name
            - Postal and email address
            - Gender identity
            - Phone number
            - Age and birthday
            - Race and ethnicity

        Other types of basic customer data include things like a customer’s work industry and occupation, income,
        IP address, and social media handles.

        Basic customer data is useful for businesses and marketers because it helps to create buyer personas and get a
        clearer picture of the demographics your business is appealing to.

    2) Interaction data
        Interaction, or engagement data, refers to data related to how your customers interact with your business
        across various touchpoints. Rather than looking at your audience members individually, engagement data looks
        at your audience as a whole.

        Customer engagement and interaction data comes in the form of:

            - Website visits
            - Click-through rates (CTR)
            - Bounce rates
            - Conversions
            - Ad engagement, like reach, clicks, and interactions
            - Social media posts and video engagement, including likes, comments, and shares
            - Email engagement, like clicks, forwards, and bounce rates

        This data also comes from product or service information like customer purchasing habits and overall popularity.

        Customer interaction data is important for understanding the attitudes and habits of your target audience.
        With it, you can create well-informed marketing campaigns that better appeal to your audience.

    3) Behavioral data
        Behavioral customer data is similar to customer interaction data but a little more defined. Behavioral data
        looks at a customer’s direct engagement with your business. Depending on the industry you’re in, interaction
        and behavioral data can sometimes be combined.

        Behavioral customer data includes:

            - Purchase history
            - Abandoned shopping carts
            - Subscription renewals and cancellations
            - Product order values
            - User duration on your site
            - Heat maps for mouse movement data like clicks and scrolling

    4) Attitudinal data
        Last but not least is attitudinal data. Attitudinal data is comprised of first-hand opinions from customers on
        your business, services, and products. Unlike the previous three types of customer data, attitudinal data is a
        bit harder to process.

        Basic, interaction, and behavioral data include hard numbers that can’t really be disputed—these data points
        are clearly stated for you to interpret. Attitudinal data, on the other hand, is a bit different.

        Rather than numbers, attitudinal data consists of:

            - Customer and client reviews
            - Online survey responses
            - In-person interactions with customers
            - Word-of-mouth reviews
            - Attitudinal data is a bit trickier to process because not every review is written the same. Some
            customers may be extremely detailed with their reviews and survey responses, while others keep it short
            and to the point.

        As a business owner, marketer, or customer service representative, it’s your job to extract the important
        information from these customer reviews and feedback responses and turn them into valuable, actionable data.

How different types of data can be collected

    1) Basic data
        - Data forms

    2) Interaction data
        - Website's analytics page
        - Paid marketing social media campaigns

    3) Behavioral data
        - Website
        - Email subscriptions
        - General sales funnel

    4) Attitudinal data
        - Surveys
        - Feedback forms
        - Extract data directly from business operations


How are companies collecting customer data (https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html):

Customer data can be collected in three ways: by directly asking customers, by indirectly tracking customers, and by
appending other sources of customer data to your own.
